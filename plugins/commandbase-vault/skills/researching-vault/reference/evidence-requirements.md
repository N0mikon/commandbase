# Vault Evidence Requirements

Standards for vault research findings and red flags to watch for.

## What Counts as Evidence

Research findings must include:

- Specific note paths (e.g., `Projects/my-project.md`)
- Specific folder paths (e.g., `Templates/`)
- Actual patterns found via tool exploration (not assumed)
- Counts and statistics from vault tools (tag frequency, link density)

## Not Acceptable

These phrases indicate guessing, not research:

- "The vault likely has..."
- "Based on typical Obsidian vaults..."
- "I believe there is..."
- "Usually vaults have..."
- "Most Obsidian users..."

Every claim needs a note path or folder reference from actual vault exploration.

## Red Flags - STOP and Explore

If you notice any of these, STOP immediately:

- About to answer without exploring the vault via tools
- Using "likely", "probably", "typically" about the vault
- Describing patterns without note/folder references
- Synthesizing before all exploration is complete
- Answering based on general Obsidian knowledge instead of this vault
- Feeling like the question is "too simple" for exploration
- About to write research document without exploration results

**When you hit a red flag:**
1. Stop and acknowledge the shortcut
2. Use MCP tools or file-system tools to explore
3. Wait for results
4. Only then continue

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I already know this vault" | Your knowledge is stale. Explore with tools. Verify. |
| "This is a simple question" | Simple questions have complex answers. Research. |
| "Exploration takes too long" | Wrong answers take longer to fix. Explore. |
| "I can see the pattern" | Patterns need evidence. Find note references. |
| "The user is in a hurry" | Wrong research wastes more time. Be thorough. |
| "I'll just check one note" | One note isn't research. Explore broadly. |
| "Similar to another vault" | This vault is unique. Verify everything. |

## Verification Checklist

Before writing the research document:

- [ ] Explored the vault using MCP tools and/or file-system tools
- [ ] All exploration completed before synthesis
- [ ] Every finding has a note path or folder reference
- [ ] No phrases like "likely" or "probably" about the vault
- [ ] Cross-referenced findings across dimensions
- [ ] Noted any gaps or areas needing follow-up exploration
