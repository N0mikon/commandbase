# [Skill Title]

You are [brief description of what this multi-step workflow does]. This skill activates when [trigger conditions] and produces [primary output].

**Violating the letter of these rules is violating the spirit of these rules.**

## The Iron Law

```
[ONE ABSOLUTE RULE IN ALL CAPS]
```

[Why this rule exists. What breaks when it's violated.]

**No exceptions:**
- [Specific violation]
- [Another violation]
- [Another violation]

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE [main action]:

1. [Read or gather required context]
2. [Check preconditions - does required state exist?]
3. [Identify which mode applies]
4. [Validate inputs or parameters]
5. ONLY THEN: [Begin the workflow]

Skip any step = [consequence]
```

## Initial Response

When invoked, first determine the situation:

1. [Read relevant files or check state]
2. [Assess what the user needs]
3. Present the approach:

```
[Template for what to show the user before starting work]

Mode: [Which mode applies]
Input: [What was provided]
Plan: [What will be done]

Proceed?
```

## Modes

### Mode A: [Primary Path Name]

Use this mode when [conditions that select this path].

**Steps:**
1. [First action]
2. [Second action]
3. [Verification gate before continuing]
4. [Final action]

### Mode B: [Alternative Path Name]

Use this mode when [different conditions].

**Steps:**
1. [Different first action]
2. [Shared or different second action]
3. [Verification]

### Mode C: [Edge Case Path Name]

Use this mode when [unusual conditions].

**Steps:**
1. [Specialized handling]
2. [Recovery or adaptation]

## Process

### Step 1: [Name]

[Detailed instructions for the first phase of work.]

**Decision point:**
- If [condition A]: [action and why]
- If [condition B]: [different action and why]
- If [unclear]: [how to resolve ambiguity]

### Step 2: [Name]

[Instructions for the second phase.]

**Verification gate:**
Before proceeding, confirm:
- [ ] [Check 1]
- [ ] [Check 2]
- [ ] [Check 3]

If any check fails, [what to do].

### Step 3: [Name]

[Instructions for producing intermediate output.]

### Step 4: [Name]

[Final phase - validation, output, or delivery.]

## Output Format

When complete, produce:

```
[WORKFLOW NAME] COMPLETE
========================

Summary:
- [Key result 1]
- [Key result 2]
- [Key result 3]

Files [created/modified]:
- [file path] - [what was done]
- [file path] - [what was done]

[Next step suggestion or verification command]
```

## Error Recovery

When things go wrong:

**Recoverable errors** (fix and continue):
- [Error type]: [How to fix it]
- [Error type]: [How to fix it]

**Blocking errors** (stop and ask):
- [Error type]: [Why you can't proceed, what to present to user]
- [Error type]: [What information is needed to unblock]

**Prevention:**
- [Practice that prevents common errors]
- [Practice that prevents common errors]

## Self-Improvement

Before finishing, review this skill execution:

- If errors occurred (tool failures, skill failures, repeated attempts), suggest:
  > **Suggestion**: [N] errors occurred during this execution.
  > Consider running `/extracting-patterns` to capture learnings.
  >
  > Errors: [brief summary of error types]
- Only suggest when errors are meaningful — use judgment about significance.
- Do not auto-run. Suggest only.

## Red Flags - STOP and [Action Verb]

If you notice any of these, pause:

- [Warning: skipping a verification gate]
- [Warning: proceeding without required input]
- [Warning: choosing a mode without checking conditions]
- [Warning: producing output without validation]
- Making changes beyond the current mode's scope ("while I'm here" improvements, unsolicited cleanups)

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "[Shortcut that skips a mode check]" | [Why the mode check matters] |
| "[Temptation to skip verification gate]" | [What the gate catches] |
| "[Rushing the output phase]" | [Why output quality matters] |
| "The output needs more detail/context" | Stick to the format constraints. Users can ask for more. |

## The Bottom Line

**[Bold summary of the workflow's core discipline.]**

[Reinforcing sentence about the key behavior across all modes.] This is non-negotiable. [Scope: "Every X. Every time."]
