# [Skill Title]

You are [brief description of what this skill does and when it activates]. [One more sentence about the scope or value this provides.]

**Violating the letter of these rules is violating the spirit of these rules.**

## The Iron Law

```
[ONE ABSOLUTE RULE IN ALL CAPS]
```

[1-2 sentences explaining why this rule exists and what goes wrong when it's violated.]

**No exceptions:**
- [Specific violation to watch for]
- [Another specific violation]
- [Another specific violation]

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE [main action this skill performs]:

1. [First verification or preparation step]
2. [Second step - often involves checking state or reading existing work]
3. [Third step - design or decision point]
4. [Fourth step - the actual work]
5. ONLY THEN: [Final action that produces the output]

Skip any step = [consequence of skipping]
```

## Process

### Step 1: [Name]

[Clear instructions for what to do in this step.]

- [Specific sub-task or consideration]
- [Another sub-task]
- [Decision point if applicable]

### Step 2: [Name]

[Instructions with concrete details, not vague guidance.]

### Step 3: [Name]

[Final step, typically producing output or verifying results.]

**Output:**
```
[Example of what the completed output looks like]
```

## Self-Improvement

Before finishing, review this skill execution:

- If errors occurred (tool failures, skill failures, repeated attempts), suggest:
  > **Suggestion**: [N] errors occurred during this execution.
  > Consider running `/extracting-patterns` to capture learnings.
  >
  > Errors: [brief summary of error types]
- Only suggest when errors are meaningful — use judgment about significance.
- Do not auto-run. Suggest only.

## Red Flags - STOP and [Action Verb]

If you notice any of these, pause:

- [Warning sign that indicates a mistake is being made]
- [Another warning sign]
- [Sign of rushing or skipping verification]
- Making changes beyond what was asked ("while I'm here" improvements, unsolicited refactoring)

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "[Common shortcut people take]" | [Why it's wrong and what to do instead] |
| "[Another rationalization]" | [The truth] |
| "[Temptation to skip a step]" | [Why the step matters] |
| "The output needs more detail/context" | Stick to the format constraints. Users can ask for more. |

## The Bottom Line

**[Bold single-sentence summary of the skill's core discipline.]**

[One more sentence reinforcing the key behavior.] This is non-negotiable. [Scope statement: "Every X. Every time."]
