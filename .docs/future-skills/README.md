# Future Skills

Ideas for skills to build. Each file captures one concept with its motivation, design notes, and open questions.

## Index

| [brainstorming.md](brainstorming.md) | `/brainstorming-code`, `/brainstorming-vault`, `/brainstorming-services` | Implemented (Phase 4) |
| [naming-session.md](naming-session.md) | `/naming-session` | Implemented (Phase 1) |
| [vault-rdspi.md](vault-rdspi.md) | `/starting-vault`, `/researching-vault`, `/designing-vault`, `/structuring-vault`, `/planning-vault`, `/implementing-vault`, `/importing-vault` | Implemented (Phase 6) |
| [services-rdspi.md](services-rdspi.md) | `/researching-services`, `/designing-services`, `/structuring-services`, `/planning-services`, `/implementing-services` | Concept (Phase 7) |
| [researching-repo.md](researching-repo.md) | `/researching-repo` | Implemented (Phase 3) |
| [creating-posts.md](creating-posts.md) | `/creating-posts` | Implemented (Phase 5) |
| ~~re-evaluate-existing.md~~ | `/auditing-skills`, `/auditing-agents`, `/bookmarking-code`, `/learning-from-sessions`, `docs-updater`, `/validating-code` vs `/reviewing-changes` | Archived (decisions captured in roadmap, executed in Phases 0-2) |

## How These Connect

All three domains (code, vault, services) share the same BRDSPI phase structure with domain-specific tooling at each step. `/naming-session` ties into phase-by-phase work across all domains. Brainstorming skills are the pre-BRDSPI entry point for each domain. `/researching-repo` completes the research stack alongside `/researching-web`, `/researching-frameworks`, and `/researching-code`.

Code and vault domains are fully implemented. Services domain (Phase 7) is the remaining concept.
